### Project Proposal

Lately I've been working on and completed my project proposal based off my plan to do a workplacement at Nelson Data Systems. What I'll be doing there should be quite interesting as it relates to machine learning and AI which is an area I have some interest in. The project itself that I'll be working on is a continuation of a previous students project. Stewart Metcalfe project's was about using Azure and machine learning to have an AI go through a rugby match and identify specific plays and events that can later be referenced by the coaches who submitted those matches.

I believe that working on the project proposal in this way will help with my placement as I have planned out what steps I will take in order to get the end product. I hope that it turns out useful and I don't have a hard time while at my work placement.
