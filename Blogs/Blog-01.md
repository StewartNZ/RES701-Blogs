### Introduction into Research

__What do you think Research is:__
- Research is gathering information for a particular topic.
- Research also involves verifying the importance and accuracy of gathered information.
- Research can be gathered from all sorts of different mediums including the internet, books, television and people.

__Do you think that you will ever need research skills:__
Yes, I do simple and complicated research all the time, a specific example would be looking to get a new motorbike. I gathered information from many places including family, the internet and from salespeople at local stores. I had to research what my price range would be and how powerful of a bike I wanted.

__What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for:__
- I think a research journal is a place where you put gathered information to sort and grade in regards to importance.
- I think a journal is written for yourself to keep gathered information in one place.

__What is Plagiarism:__
- To me plagiarism is copying information from sources and then claiming it as your own words.
- It can also just be taking information and only changing it slightly without stating where the information came from.
- In short I think it is claiming information as your own when it isn't.

__Why should you avoid it:__
- You should avoid it because it could violate copyrights
- Another thought is that when publishing/submitting papers you are lying to yourself and not fully understanding the topic you are studying.
